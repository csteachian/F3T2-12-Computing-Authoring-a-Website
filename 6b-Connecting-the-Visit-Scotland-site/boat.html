  <h2>UNUSUAL PLACES TO STAY - BOAT</h2>

<h3>A night's sleep aboard a boat is a really unique way to see Scotland. Wake up to the sounds of lapping water or eat al fresco on the deck as you set sail on a yacht or see the countryside from a canal or barge.</h3>

<h4>There are many vessels to choose from that don't require any previous boat handling skills. Experienced sailors can rent boats for hire.</h4>
