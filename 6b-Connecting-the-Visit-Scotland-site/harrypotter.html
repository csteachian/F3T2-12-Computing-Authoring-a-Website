  <h2>FILM & TV LOCATIONS - HARRY POTTER</h2>

  <h3>It's hard to believe that June 2017 was the 20th anniversary of JK Rowling publishing her debut novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. In 1997, no one could have predicted the wildly successful book sales and box office smashing blockbusters that would follow. Here in Scotland, you can see where the Edinburgh-dweller found her inspiration, and where the magic all began.</h3>
