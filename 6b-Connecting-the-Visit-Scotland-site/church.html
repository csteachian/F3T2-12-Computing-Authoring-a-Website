  <h2>UNUSUAL PLACES TO STAY - CHURCH</h2>

<h3>If you're a lover of stained-glass windows, intricate architecture and a historic atmosphere, then a stay in a Scottish church is one for you. You could stay in a former country abbey, city-centre church, a traditional manse once home to a church minister, or even in a working cathedral on an island.</h3>

<h4>Soak up the heavenly features and indulge in a spot of luxury with many converted churches offering extra facilities to make your stay more enjoyable.</h4>
