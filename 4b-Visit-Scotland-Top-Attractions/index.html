    <h2>SPOTLIGHT ON ABERDEEN</h2>

<p>This is a city right on the north east coast. It's a place where the harbour meets the city centre, where you may just see the harbour's resident pod of dolphins playing in the waters or enjoy a beach stroll alongside some serious shopping.</p>

<p>It's a city where you can easily surf or take in a theatre performance  in the same day. Aberdeen is famous for its stunning, sparkling, granite buildings and monuments which shimmer in the sunlight and the warming tones of  'Doric', the local Scots dialect you'll hear in the streets.</p>
