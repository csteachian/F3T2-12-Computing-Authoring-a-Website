# 5. Add the green image

To display the green image on the screen **with height 25 percent of the original size** you should use one of the three lines of code:

```html:
<img src="images\green.jpg" width="150%">
```

```html:
<img src="images\green.jpg" height="150%">
```

```html:
<img src="images\green.jpg" height="25%">
```

Select one of the three lines of code shown above and add this to the line directly underneath the following comment:

```html:
<!-- Add the green image here -->
```

If you have done this correctly you should see the following web page:
