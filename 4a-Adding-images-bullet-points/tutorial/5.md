# 6. Add the yellow image

To display the yellow image on the screen **with width 250 pixels and height 50 percent of the original size** you should be able to use the ```<img>``` tag appropriately.

Add this to the line directly underneath the following comment:

```html:
<!-- Add the yellow image here -->
```
