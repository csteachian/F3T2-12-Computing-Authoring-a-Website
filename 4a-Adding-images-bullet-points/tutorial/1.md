# 2. Image Tags

You can add an image to a website by using the following tag:

```html:
<img src="imagename.jpg">
```

You can alter the ```width``` and ```height``` of each image by providing appropriate values for each parameter. For example:

```html:
<img src="imagename.jpg" width="50px" height="150%">
```

You can (and should) also include ```alt``` text to describe the image. This can be used by screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users.

```html:
<img src="imagename.jpg" alt="A sunny day in Aberdeen">
```
