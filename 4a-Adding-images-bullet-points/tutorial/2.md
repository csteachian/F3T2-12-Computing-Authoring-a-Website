# 3. Add the red image

To display the red image on the screen you should use one of the three lines of code:

```html:
<img src="images\red.jpg">
```

```html:
<img src="red.jpg">
```

```html:
<img file="images\red.jpg">
```

Select one of the three lines of code shown above and add this to the line directly underneath the following comment:

```html:
<body>
<!-- Add the red image here -->
```
