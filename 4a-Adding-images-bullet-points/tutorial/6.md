# 7. Alt text

You can (and should) also include ```alt``` text to describe the image. This can be used by screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users.

```html:
<img src="imagename.jpg" alt="A sunny day in Aberdeen">
```

You should now add suitable ```alt``` text to the four images in ```index.html```.
