# 2. Video Tag

You can add a video to a website by using the following tag structure:

```html:
<video>
  <source src="videoname.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

You can alter the width and height of each video by providing appropriate values for each parameter. For example:

```html:
<video width="100%" height="350px">
```

There are also parameters which **autoplay** or **loop** the video clip.

```html:
<video autoplay loop>
```

You can also remove the sound from a video by using the **muted** parameter. You can even change if the **controls** display or not.

```html:
<video muted controls>
```
