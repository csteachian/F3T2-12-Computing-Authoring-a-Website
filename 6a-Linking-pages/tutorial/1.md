# Anchor tag

The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the `href` attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

```html:
<a href="page.html">
```

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red
